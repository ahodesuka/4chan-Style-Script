## 4chan X
This userscript is intended to be used along side [4chan X](http://mayhemydg.github.com/4chan-x/).  As of now only 2.30+ is supported.
Ensure both `Auto Hide QR` and `Persistent QR` options are checked in 4chan X's settings.

## Known Issues
For exhentai source to work (as intended) in chrome you must install with [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Ninjakit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gpbepnljaakggeobkclonlkhbdgccfek).

If you experience "flashing" of 4chan's default stylesheet, try adding this to your adblock filter: `http://static.4chan.org/css/*`
